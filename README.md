# PixHero
Angular made web application

  This is a simple character selection screen that could be used for a video game to pick, crate new
or manage your hero at the beginning of the game. For example it could be combined with the code of
my other repository (see repository named 'JavaScriptGame') and worked around to optimize a fully
functioning browser text-game.
  I used Visual Studio Code to make this, you will need NPM and the Angular CLI installed in order
to use it.  
  I don't own any of the images used for the app, they are just random links to images I found with
Google.
